# EchoCenter

EchoCenter is a Python program designed to help users efficiently archive and compress files on Windows systems to save space and improve load times. By converting directories into compressed zip files, users can optimize storage space and manage file backups more effectively.

## Features

- Compresses entire directories into zip files.
- Preserves directory structure within the archive.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation

Clone the repository or download the `echo_center.py` file to your local machine.

## Usage

To use EchoCenter, you need to run it from the command line. Below is the syntax for running the program:

```bash
python echo_center.py <directory> <archive_name>
```

- `<directory>`: The path to the directory you want to compress.
- `<archive_name>`: The desired name for the resulting zip archive file.

### Example

Suppose you want to compress a directory named `my_folder` into an archive called `my_archive.zip`. You would use the following command:

```bash
python echo_center.py my_folder my_archive.zip
```
